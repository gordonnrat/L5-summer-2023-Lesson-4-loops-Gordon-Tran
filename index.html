        /* Exercises 1-2 while loop
        Exercise 1 
        Create a while loop to count to 10.
         1. Select the count p tag and assign it a variable.
         2. Create a variable to keep count, call it counterNum. 
         3. Create a while loop with the condition to run until counterNum gets to 10. 
         4. Inside the loop, set the innerHTML of the p tag to show counterNum. 
            Make cumulative with +=
            Don't forget to increment counterNum! */
        /* Exercise 2
        Show the sum total of the numbers between 1 and 10.
         1. Above the while loop you just created, make a variable called sum and set it to 0;
         2. Inside the while loop, make sum += to counterNum plus itself.
         3. After the loop is finished, show the sum total of the numbers. */

        const count = document.querySelector('#count');
        let counterNum = 1;
        let sum = 0;
        
        while (counterNum <= 10) {
            count.innerHTML += counterNum + '<br />';
            sum = sum + counterNum;
            counterNum++;
           
        }
        count.innerHTML += 'Total: ' + sum;






        /* Exercise 3  do while loop
        Create a do while loop to calculate a multiplication table 
        1. Select the multiply p tag and assign it a variable.
        2. Create a variable to keep count of the number of times the code will be repeated. 
        3. Create a variable for the number to be multiplied. 
        4. Create the do while loop. The do statement should only have 2 lines of code inside, one to perform the math calculation and show it on the page, one to increment the counter.
        Use innerHTML and the line break tag <br /> when showing each calculation.
        The while condition should set to repeat up to 10. */







        /* Exercise 4-6 for loop
        Exercise 4
        Create a for loop that repeats the line: "I will not stick my chewing gum under my desk." 100 times.
        1. Select the naughty p tag and assign it a variable
        2. Create a for loop that repeats the line 100 times and show it on the page. Try including the iterationa variable so that your lines are numbered. */
        /* Exercise 5
        3. Practice the continue statement by stating "My hand is tired" at line 50 in the for loop. 
        Use a conditional statement to check the value of your iteration variable, then insert the text and continue. */
        /* Exercise 6
        4. Practice the break statement by stopping the for loop at line 75. 
         Use a conditional statement to check the value of your iteration variable, then insert the text "I couldn't finish" and break.*/

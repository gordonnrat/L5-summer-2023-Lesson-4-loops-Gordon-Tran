        /* Exercises 1-2 while loop
        Exercise 1 
        Create a while loop to count to 10.
         1. Select the count p tag and assign it a variable.
         2. Create a variable to keep count, call it counterNum. 
         3. Create a while loop with the condition to run until counterNum gets to 10. 
         4. Inside the loop, set the innerHTML of the p tag to show counterNum. 
            Make cumulative with +=
            Don't forget to increment counterNum! */
            /* Exercise 2
            Show the sum total of the numbers between 1 and 10.
            1. Above the while loop you just created, make a variable called sum and set it to 0;
            2. Inside the while loop, make sum += to counterNum plus itself.
         3. After the loop is finished, show the sum total of the numbers. */

        Create a do while loop to calculate a multiplication table 
        1. Select the multiply p tag and assign it a variable.
        2. Create a variable to keep count of the number of times the code will be repeated. 
        3. Create a variable for the number to be multiplied. 
        4. Create the do while loop. The do statement should only have 2 lines of code inside, one to perform the math calculation and show it on the page, one to increment the counter.
        Use innerHTML and the line break tag <br /> when showing each calculation.
        The while condition should set to repeat up to 10. */

        Exercise 4
        Create a for loop that repeats the line: "I will not stick my chewing gum under my desk." 100 times.
